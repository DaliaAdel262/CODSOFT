                    Princess Diana, often referred to as the "People's Princess," was 
                    a beloved member of the British royal family known for her humanitarian work 
                    and charisma. She captivated the world with her grace, compassion, and 
                    dedication to charitable causes, including efforts to raise awareness about 
                    HIV/AIDS and landmine victims. Diana's tragic death in 1997 sparked an outpouring of 
                    grief globally, leaving behind a legacy of kindness, advocacy, and social change.
